//! A colour-mixing practice game, and a member of the small Rust PWA family.
//!
//! The split the template demonstrates, kept:
//!
//! * [`mix`] — the app's logic. No `web-sys`, no `js-sys`, no
//!   `wasm-bindgen`, so it compiles natively and is unit tested by plain
//!   `cargo test`.
//! * `ui` — the browser layer, compiled only for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.
//!   Every `document`, `localStorage` and service-worker call lives here, and
//!   nothing else does.
//!
//! `cargo build --release` writes the whole site to `dist/` through `build.rs`.
//! There is no server, no binary and no run step: the build is the product.

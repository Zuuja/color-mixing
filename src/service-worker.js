// Browser lifecycle/cache plumbing only; all app logic remains Rust.
//
// The whole worker is install, activate, fetch. Four rules hold it together:
//
// * Every path is relative to `self.location`, so the app installs and works
//   from whatever subdirectory it is published under.
// * The cache name is content-versioned by `build.rs`, which hashes the bytes
//   of every other shell file — the wasm included — and this template. Change
//   the app, or this caching logic, and the cache name changes with it.
// * An update never swaps itself in unasked. Left alone it waits for every
//   page it controls to close, so a live app never has the wasm swapped out
//   from under it. The one ask that exists comes from this app's own page
//   (see `message` below), which reloads as the handover happens, so no page
//   ever straddles the two versions.
// * The fetch handler only ever answers for a URL inside this app's own
//   directory, checked on every request rather than assumed from the scope.
//   Scope is a registration's claim, not a promise, and these apps share one
//   origin with pages that are not this app.
// * The manifest is the one precached URL the fetch handler never answers
//   from the cache. It decides what an install is, so it must always be a
//   fresh read: a cached copy would let a fresh install re-derive the app's
//   identity from a manifest older than the last change to it.

const IS_OWN = url => url.startsWith(ROOT.href);
// The manifest's URL on its own. It stays in ASSETS — a manifest that 404s
// should still fail the install, loudly — but it is the one precached URL the
// fetch handler will never answer out of the cache (see the fourth rule).
const MANIFEST = new URL('manifest.webmanifest', ROOT).href;

// The page's ask. `nudge_worker_update` in `ui.rs` sends this when it has a
// worker installed and waiting: this worker takes over at once, and the page
// — the sender — hears the resulting `controllerchange` and reloads. A page
// that never asks is never swapped, which keeps the guarantee above; the
// message is the ask, and it comes from the one client that immediately
// steps out of the way.

  //
  // The manifest is the one own-directory GET that always goes to the network.
  // It is what the browser reads to decide what app an install *is*: while a
  // cached copy answered, a fresh install of this app could read a manifest
  // from before any change to it, and derive the same stale identity the
  // family once shared — the very bug the identity fix was meant to retire.
  // The manifest is tiny; no offline entry point needs it cached.
